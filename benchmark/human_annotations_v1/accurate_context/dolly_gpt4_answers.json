The Salvation Army's theology is derived from Methodism and it uses military ranks as titles. It does not celebrate Baptism and Holy Communion, but its doctrine aligns with the Wesleyan\u2013Arminian tradition. The current international leader is General Brian Peddle. The Salvation Army is one of the world's largest providers of social aid, with operating costs of $2.6 billion in 2004, helping over 32 million people in the U.S. alone. It also works in refugee camps, particularly in Africa. In the U.S., it is the fourth largest charity, with private donations exceeding $2 billion in 2022.\n\nWithout additional data, it's not possible to provide information on who and how much traffic is drawn to this page from which regions around the world.",
