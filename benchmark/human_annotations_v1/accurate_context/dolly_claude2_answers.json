This caused all the Cauldron-Born to die at once.\n\n- In the battle at Annuvin, Taran used Dyrnwyn to kill Arawn, who had taken the form of a serpent. \n\n- With Arawn's death, his stronghold of Annuvin was destroyed in flames, destroying all the magical implements inside. \n\n- After the battle, it is mentioned that Dyrnwyn began to fade, losing its magic. This was because with Arawn's demise, all magic was fading from Prydain.\n\nSo in summary, Dyrnwyn lost its power when Arawn was killed by it, as his death signaled the end of magic in Prydain.",

It can fill in boilerplate code and speed up development.\n\n- Translation between programming languages - Copilot is able to describe code in one language in natural language, and generate equivalent code in another language.\n\n- Comment to code conversion - Copilot can take code comments and generate runnable code from them. This allows it to help implement intended functionality described in comments.\n\n- Assistance with unfamiliar frameworks/languages - By reducing time spent on documentation, Copilot can help developers navigate and work with unfamiliar coding frameworks and languages more efficiently.",

They are known to travel far up rivers, and have been known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, about 1,100 kilometres (700 mi) from the ocean.\" Their ability to osmoregulate and maintain the proper salt balance in their bodies allows bull sharks to transition between marine and freshwater habitats.",

The passage states that \"commercial exploitation is currently restricted to Latin America, and chiefly to Chile.\" It mentions experimental fisheries in Argentina, Mexico and New Zealand, but indicates commercial fishing is focused in Chile, targeting species like Pleuroncodes monodon, P. planipes, and Cervimunida johni. Other countries in Latin America like El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama are also mentioned as having squat lobster fisheries, though on a smaller scale compared to Chile.",

Key reasons:\n\n- The rainy season from November to April brings tropical cyclones and storms, which could disrupt travel plans. The dry season has more stable weather.\n\n- The average temperature during the dry season ranges from 24.0\u00b0C to 28.0\u00b0C (75.2\u00b0F to 82.4\u00b0F), which is pleasant for most travelers. During the rainy season it gets hotter, from 28.0\u00b0C to 32.0\u00b0C (82.4\u00b0F to 89.6\u00b0F).\n\n- Humidity is lower during the dry season at around 80% on average, compared to very high humidity during the rainy season. Lower humidity provides more comfort.\n\n- There is a reduced risk of erosion and landslides during the dry season, making hiking and outdoor activities safer. \n\n- Visibility for sightseeing may be better during the drier months.\n\nSo for favorable weather conditions, outdoor activities, and comfort, the dry season from May to October appears to be the best time to visit Wallis and Futuna.",
