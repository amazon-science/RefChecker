The sandwich was then popularized by Charles Schimmel, the owner of the hotel, who added Swiss cheese and thousand island dressing to the sandwich and put it on rye bread. The sandwich eventually gained national fame when a former employee of the hotel won the national sandwich idea contest with the recipe.

OPEC has had a limited impact on world oil supply and price stability, as there is frequent cheating by members on their commitments to one another, and as member commitments reflect what they would do even in the absence of OPEC. \nCurrent OPEC members are Algeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.
