It was used by the Greeks to trick the Trojans into letting them into their city, where they were able to conquer and win the war. The Trojan Horse is not mentioned in Homer's Iliad, but it is briefly mentioned in the Odyssey. In the Aeneid by Virgil, the Greeks constructed a huge wooden horse and hid a select force of men inside, including Odysseus himself. The Greeks pretended to sail away, and the Trojans pulled the horse into their city as a victory trophy. That night, the Greek force crept out of the horse and opened the gates for the rest of the Greek army, which had sailed back under the cover of darkness. The Greeks entered and destroyed the city, ending the war.",

The young salmon, called fry, then migrate to the ocean where they live like sea fish. As adults, they return to fresh water to reproduce. Some populations of salmon are restricted to fresh water throughout their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn, and tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems. The percent of straying depends on the species of salmon.
