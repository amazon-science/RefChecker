However, some relevant information from the passages:\n\n- Passage 6 indicates that once the IRS has notified H&R Block that the refund is ready, it usually takes 2-3 business days for H&R Block to deposit the refund into the customer's bank account. \n\n- Passage 8 notes that if the direct deposit does not go through, the IRS will send a paper check in 6-8 weeks. \n\n- Passage 5 suggests there can sometimes be delays in getting refunds if the preparer has not yet completed the taxes. \n\n- Passage 4 mentions some common mistakes that can cause refund delays.\n\nSo in summary, it seems the timeframe can range from 2-3 business days for direct deposit up to 6-8 weeks for a mailed check, depending on the situation.

This suggests Skype can be monitored by third party software.\n\n- Passage 5 states that Skype calls are routinely monitored by Microsoft and government agencies, so Skype is not considered a fully secure system. \n\n- Passages 4 and 7 describe how Skype managers can access detailed activity reports and usage information for Skype members, indicating some internal monitoring capabilities.\n\n- Passage 8 notes that even with encryption, hidden microphones or webcams could bypass security measures and monitor Skype sessions. \n\nSo in summary, the evidence suggests that Skype calls and chats can be monitored to some degree by third party software, Skype/Microsoft itself, government agencies, and potentially by hardware/environment surveillance. While it encrypts sessions, Skype does not seem to be a fully secure and private system without risks of monitoring.",

It says this Hyperspace Mountain transformation is expected to last until late 2016, implying Space Mountain is still operating.\n\n- Passages 4-6 describe the current Hyperspace Mountain experience in detail, indicating the ride is open and operating with a Star Wars theme. \n\n- Passage 7 discusses the opening of Space Mountain in 1977, confirming it is an existing open ride.\n\nSo in summary, multiple passages indicate or imply that Space Mountain is currently open at Disneyland, even if it is temporarily operating as Hyperspace Mountain.

The psychoactive compounds in marijuana like THC are believed to contribute to this risk (Passage 9). \n\nOn the other hand, other passages suggest that the association between marijuana and mental illness is correlational, not causational (Passage 1). Some passages even indicate that marijuana can help treat certain mental health conditions when used properly (Passages 3, 4, 7). \n\nOverall, the evidence seems inconclusive. While marijuana use may exacerbate existing mental illness or increase risk in vulnerable populations, it does not appear there is definitive evidence that marijuana directly causes mental illness in most users. More research is needed to understand the nuanced relationship between marijuana and mental health.",

Gdynia is described as a \"major seaport\" and former naval port. \n\n- Passage 7 states that the Port of Gdansk is \"one of the largest seaports on the Baltic Sea\", implying there are other ports comparable in size. \n\n- Passage 8 describes Gdynia as \"Poland's most important port\".\n\n- Passage 9 discusses specialized cargo handling equipment at the Port of Gdansk, but does not clearly indicate it is the main port.\n\nSo in summary, the passages suggest Gdynia, not Gdansk, is likely the main port in Poland based on it handling most cruise ships, being described as a major seaport and Poland's most important port. There is no clear evidence identifying Gdansk as the main port.",

If you have health care expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income, you may be able to deduct yearly concierge medicine service fees, says Lipton.\"\n\n- Passage 3 reiterates this, stating the threshold is currently 7.5% but will be increasing to 10%. \n\n- Passage 4 also states the fees may be deductible for patients who itemize medical expenses on their tax returns.\n\n- Passage 5 and 8 reiterate that the fees may be tax deductible if they exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income.\n\nSo in summary, concierge medical fees can be tax deductible if they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, according to multiple passages.

It states they are linked by a common factor - a diet high in fructose. \n\n- Passage 1 also notes that high uric acid levels are associated with high triglyceride levels, but does not indicate a direct causal relationship.\n\n- Passage 6 mentions that obesity is linked to insulin resistance, which can cause elevated triglycerides as well as high uric acid levels and gout. \n\n- Passage 7 notes that excess calories and dietary fat can be converted to triglycerides in the body. However, this is not directly related to gout.\n\nIn summary, while gout (caused by high uric acid) and high triglycerides are associated, the passages do not indicate that gout directly affects or causes high triglyceride levels. The connection appears to be indirect, through factors like diet and obesity.",

Multiple coats of sealer should be applied until the grout cannot absorb anymore (Passage 7). \n\n- Using an electric floor scrubber/polisher can help brighten tile and grout (Passages 1, 2, 5).\n\n- Specialty grout cleaners, brushes, and steam cleaners can also be effective for DIY grout cleaning (Passages 4, 6, 9).  \n\n- Sealing the grout every 4-6 months is recommended to prevent dirt buildup and help tiles last longer (Passage 7).\n\n- Overall, there are various DIY methods and products available for effectively cleaning grout at home without the use of harsh chemicals. Proper sealing is also important for ongoing grout maintenance.",

Medical diagnosis alone does not determine eligibility.\n\nSo in summary, the passages suggest school psychologists can contribute expertise as part of a team determining special education eligibility and services, but do not independently diagnose medical conditions like ADHD.

Do not use pool-grade diatomaceous earth.\n\n- Lightly coat a thin layer of diatomaceous earth in areas where roaches are found or may hide, such as cracks and crevices, behind appliances, in cabinets, along baseboards, around pipes and drains, in attics and basements. \n\n- You can apply it directly into roach nests or hideouts. Use a bulb puffer to blow it into cracks and crevices.\n\n- Apply during dry weather for maximum effect. If applied outdoors, reapply after rain. \n\n- Apply lightly, as roaches won't walk through heavy dustings.\n\n- Avoid damp or wet areas, as moisture reduces the effectiveness. \n\n- For preventative measures, sprinkle diatomaceous earth around pet food areas.\n\nThe sharp particles cut and scratch the roaches' bodies, causing dehydration and death. Diatomaceous earth provides a non-toxic pest control option.",

They were the most famous secret religious rites of ancient Greece (Passages 3, 4, 8, 9).\n\n- They consisted of the Lesser Mysteries held in March and the Greater Mysteries held later in the year. The rituals involved purification, sacrifices, processions, fasting, and drinking a special kykeon beverage (Passages 2, 3, 9).\n\n- They were practiced for over 2000 years from at least the 6th century BCE. In the 1st century CE they still held prestige under official patronage of the Athenian state (Passages 5, 6). \n\n- However, there are no definitive accounts of the mysteries continuing past the 4th century CE after Christianity became the official religion. The last known hierophant (chief priest) was in 392 CE (not mentioned in passages).\n\nSo in summary, the Eleusinian Mysteries survived for a remarkably long period from the 6th century BCE to around the 4th century CE, but evidence does not clearly indicate they continued beyond the official rise of Christianity in the late 4th century.

These passages claim it works to make money through auto-trading and has satisfied users. \n\nHowever, Passage 3 does not seem directly related to the Brit Method system. And Passages 5, 8 and 9 discuss Brita water filters, not the Brit Method trading system, so they don't provide evidence for or against the system working as claimed.\n\nOverall, there are more passages suggesting the Brit Method does work as an auto-trading system compared to those casting doubt or unrelated. But the mixed evidence in the provided passages makes it difficult to conclusively determine if the Brit Method system works as claimed for generating trading profits. More objective information evaluating the system's actual performance would help draw a firmer conclusion.",
