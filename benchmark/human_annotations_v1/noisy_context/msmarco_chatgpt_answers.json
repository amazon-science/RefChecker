The Miniature American Shepherd is a breed that could possibly be registered by the AKC in the future and has its own breed club, MASCUSA. The Australian Shepherd and the Miniature American Shepherd are genetically similar, but the Miniature American Shepherd is smaller in size, standing 13-18 inches tall at the shoulder compared to the Australian Shepherd's height of 18-23 inches. Miniature Australian Shepherds achieved AKC recognition and were renamed to Miniature American Shepherds.

Prevention techniques, such as redirecting the dog's attention to something else enjoyable, can be effective in stopping the behavior from starting. Training dogs to stop chasing on command, providing extra attention and exercise, and using fences or shock collars with proper training are also mentioned as strategies to prevent or correct car chasing behavior.",

Passage 2 mentions that some gardeners believe urine can keep deer away, but notes that close neighbors may not appreciate the smell. Passage 5 recommends reapplying urine granules regularly to keep out deer. However, Passage 1 states that deer are unlikely to associate human urine with humans unless there is also a corresponding human scent. Passage 8 mentions that predator urine is sometimes effective but not guaranteed to work. Overall, the passages suggest that while human urine may have some potential to keep deer away, it is not a foolproof solution.",
