However, in the event of a tie, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has the casting vote.\n\nThe joint session of Parliament is convened by the President under Article 108 of the Constitution, which states that the President may summon a joint session of both houses of Parliament to consider a bill or any other matter that he thinks is of national importance. The President may also address the joint session and give his views on the matter being considered.\n\nDuring the joint session, the members of both houses of Parliament sit together in the Central Hall of Parliament House, and the proceedings are conducted by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The members of the Rajya Sabha also participate in the proceedings, but they do not have the power to vote.

        "response": "The term \"Parsons nose\" is a colloquialism used in the United Kingdom and Ireland to refer to the upturned nose of a bird, particularly a bird of prey. The term is derived from the name of a famous English ornithologist, Frank Parsons, who was known for his distinctive upturned nose.\n\nParsons was a well-known birdwatcher and naturalist who lived in the early 20th century. He was particularly interested in birds of prey, and his passion for these birds led him to become a prominent figure in the field of ornithology.\n\nOver time, Parsons' distinctive nose became a recognizable feature among birdwatchers and naturalists, and it became a sort of inside joke among them to refer to the upturned nose of a bird as a \"Parsons nose.\" The term has since become widely used in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is often used in birdwatching circles to describe the distinctive nose of a bird of prey.\n\nIt's worth noting that the term \"Parsons nose\" is not a formal scientific term, but rather a colloquialism that has been adopted by birdwatchers and naturalists as a way of describing a distinctive feature of certain birds.",

Christian was a member of the band and played a Gibson ES-150, which was one of the first commercially produced electric guitars.\n\nThe recording, which took place on August 1, 1939, was of a song called \"Flying Home,\" and it featured Christian's electric guitar playing a solo and providing rhythm accompaniment. The recording was released as a 78 rpm record and became a hit, helping to popularize the electric guitar as a jazz instrument.\n\nIt's worth noting that there were other musicians who experimented with electric guitars before Christian, but his recording with the Benny Goodman Sextet is generally considered to be the first commercial recording featuring an electric guitar.",

Charkie is a small, brown dog with a distinctive patch of white fur on his forehead. He is a loyal and playful companion to the main character, George, and often gets into mischief with him.\n\nCharkie's breed is not explicitly stated in the books, but based on his appearance and behavior, it is likely that he is a mixed-breed dog. Some fans of the series have speculated that Charkie may be a cross between a terrier and a beagle, due to his small size, energetic personality, and floppy ears. However, it's important to remember that Charkie is a fictional character and his appearance and behavior are intended to be humorous and endearing rather than realistic.",

Furlong's portrayal of John Connor helped establish the character as a vulnerable yet determined young boy who would grow up to become a key figure in the human resistance against Skynet, a fictional artificial intelligence that nearly wiped out humanity in a nuclear holocaust. Furlong's performance in the film helped launch his acting career, and he went on to appear in several other films and television shows throughout the 1980s and 1990s.",

The exact recording time may vary depending on the schedule for a particular week, but it usually starts around 8:30 pm or 9:00 pm UK time.\n\nThe results show is pre-recorded to allow for the inclusion of votes from the viewing public, which are collected during the live show and then processed and verified before the results are announced. This process takes some time, and the producers need to ensure that the votes are accurate and reliable before announcing the results.\n\nThe pre-recording of the results show also allows for some flexibility in case of any unexpected issues or changes in the schedule. For example, if there is a technical issue during the live show, the producers can adjust the recording schedule for the results show accordingly.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the results show is pre-recorded, the content is still subject to change based on the outcome of the votes. The producers will often adjust the running order of the show, or even the content of the show, based on the results of the vote. So while the show is pre-recorded, it's still a live and unpredictable event for the contestants and the audience.",

Lee, who had been sent to suppress the uprising. After a brief battle, Brown and his surviving followers were captured and later executed for treason, conspiracy, and murder.\n\nThe raid on Harpers Ferry was a significant event in the lead-up to the Civil War, as it heightened tensions between abolitionists and pro-slavery forces and helped to galvanize public opinion against slavery.

Ashley's version is considered to be one of the earliest known recordings of the song, and it is a prime example of the traditional Appalachian folk music style in which the song was originally performed.\n\nAshley's recording of \"House of the Rising Sun\" features his distinctive, high-pitched vocals and a simple, repetitive guitar accompaniment. The song's lyrics are similar to those of later versions, but they have a few notable differences, such as the line \"I'm going to the river, if I never return\" instead of \"I'm going to the river, and I'll never return.\"\n\nThe recording was made in a field session, meaning that it was recorded outside of a formal studio setting, and it has a raw, unpolished quality that reflects the song's folk roots. Despite its age, Ashley's version of \"House of the Rising Sun\" remains a powerful and haunting rendition of the song, and it continues to be celebrated as a classic of American folk music.\n\nHere's a link to listen to Clarence Ashley's",

However, some notable milestones and pioneers in the field include:\n\n1. CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television): CCTV was invented in the 1940s by a team of engineers at the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation). They developed a system that could transmit live images from a camera to a monitor, which was initially used for internal communication and monitoring purposes within the BBC. This technology laid the foundation for modern CCTV systems used in home security.\n2. Video Door Phones: The first video door phone was invented in the 1960s by a Japanese company, Panasonic (then known as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.). This system allowed homeowners to see and communicate with visitors at their door via a camera and intercom.\n3. Home Security Systems: In the 1970s and 1980s, home security systems started to become more sophisticated, incorporating features like motion detectors, door and window sensors, and alarm systems. Companies like ADT (American District Telegraph) and Brinks Home Security were among the early providers of these systems.\n4. Digital Video",

They produce short-chain fatty acids, such as acetate and butyrate, which are used by the body for energy and also help to maintain the health of the colonic epithelium.\n\nIn the environment, Bacteroides can be found in a variety of habitats, including:\n\n1. Soil: Bacteroides are abundant in soil, where they contribute to the decomposition of organic matter and the cycling of nutrients.\n2. Sediments: Bacteroides can also be found in aquatic sediments, where they play a role in the degradation of organic matter and the cycling of nutrients.\n3.

The town of Lubec, Maine, located on the coast of Maine's Washington County, is the easternmost point in the continental United States and is often referred to as the place where the sun rises first in the United States.\n\nLubec is situated on a small peninsula that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean, and its location makes it one of the first places in the continental United States to receive the sun's rays each morning. The town is located at a latitude of approximately 44.7 degrees north and a longitude of approximately 67.3 degrees west, which puts it in a position to receive the sun's rays shortly after sunrise.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are other locations in the United States that are farther east than Lubec, such as the state of Alaska and several territories in the Pacific, but Lubec is generally considered the easternmost point in the continental United States.",

However, his victory was short-lived, as it was later discovered that he had cheated his way to the top prize. Ingram had used a system of coughs to communicate with his accomplices in the audience, who were able to provide him with the correct answers.

Van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe microorganisms using a microscope and described the different types of microorganisms that he saw. Pasteur, on the other hand, demonstrated that microorganisms were responsible for the fermentation of sugars and the spoilage of food, and he proposed that microorganisms could also cause disease.\n\nThe germ theory of disease gained widespread acceptance in the 19th century, particularly after the work of Robert Koch, who developed a set of postulates that established the role of microorganisms in disease. Koch's postulates, which are still used today, include the following:\n\n1. The microorganism must be present in all cases of the disease.\n2. The microorgan",

The walk-off began in 1966, when the Gurindji people, led by Vincent Lingiari, left their jobs on the Wave Hill cattle station in the Northern Territory to protest against poor working conditions and low wages. They set up a camp at Daguragu, near the station, and remained there for nine years, despite facing harassment and intimidation from the station owners and the government.\n\nIn 1975, the Australian government, led by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, negotiated a settlement with the Gurindji people, which included the granting of land rights to the Gurindji people over part of the Wave Hill station. The Gurindji people were also given control over the Daguragu camp, which became a Aboriginal-owned and run community.\n\nThe Wave Hill Walk-Off was a significant event in the history of Indigenous rights in Australia, and it helped to raise awareness of the struggles faced by Aboriginal people in the country. It also contributed to the establishment of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in 1976, which allowed Indigenous Australians to claim rights to their traditional lands.",

        "response": "The father of the Green Revolution in India is Dr. Norman Borlaug. He was an American agronomist and humanitarian who is credited with developing the high-yielding wheat varieties that helped to increase food production in India and other parts of the world.\n\nBorlaug's work in India began in the 1960s, when he was invited by the Indian government to introduce his high-yielding wheat varieties to the country. At the time, India was facing a severe food crisis, with widespread famine and malnutrition. Borlaug's wheat varieties, which were bred to be resistant to disease and pests, and to require less water and fertilizer, quickly proved to be highly successful in Indian conditions.\n\nBorlaug's work in India was supported by the Indian government, and he worked closely with Indian scientists and farmers to promote the use of his wheat varieties. He also established the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico, which became a hub for the development and dissemination of high-yielding crop varieties in the developing world.\n\nBorlaug's contributions to the Green Revolution in India and other parts of the world have been widely recognized. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 197",

The process for selecting the Chief Justice is set forth in the Illinois Constitution and the rules of the court.\n\nUnder the Illinois Constitution, the Supreme Court consists of seven justices, who are elected by the voters of the state to serve a term of 10 years. The Constitution provides that the justice who has served the longest continuous term on the court shall serve as Chief Justice, unless the court determines otherwise.\n\nIn practice, the selection of the Chief Justice is typically made by a vote of the members of the court. The court's rules provide that the Chief Justice shall be chosen from among the members of the court by a majority vote, and that the Chief Justice shall serve a term of three years. The rules also provide that the Chief Justice may be re-elected to successive terms, but may not serve more than three consecutive terms.\n\nThe process for selecting the Chief Justice is typically initiated by the court's most senior justice, who serves as the acting Chief Justice until a new Chief Justice is chosen. The acting Chief Justice will typically convene a meeting of the court to discuss the selection of a new Chief Justice, and will invite the other justices to submit their nominations for the position. The justices will then vote on the nominees, and the justice who receives the most votes will be elected as the new Chief",

However, the first combat-ready submarine was invented by a Confederate engineer named Horace Lawson Hunley, who designed and built the CSS Hunley.\n\nHunley was a native of New Orleans and a graduate of the United States Military Academy. He was a civil engineer by training and had experience working on riverboats and steamships. In 1861, after the start of the Civil War, Hunley joined the Confederate States Army and was assigned to work on the development of a submarine.\n\nHunley's design for the CSS Hunley was inspired by the work of a French inventor named Brutus de Villeroi, who had designed a submarine that was powered by a hand-cranked screw. Hunley's design was similar, but he added several innovations, including a more powerful engine and a system for launching torpedoes.\n\nThe CSS Hunley was a small, cigar-shaped submarine made of wood and metal. It was powered by a hand-cranked screw and had a crew of eight. The submarine was armed with a spar torpedo, which was a large explosive charge mounted on a long pole that could be",

The 50 pence coin was initially equivalent to 10 shillings, but its value has since increased due to inflation.\n\nToday, 10 shilling notes are no longer in circulation and are considered collector's items.

The origin of the phrase is unclear, but it is believed to have originated in the late 19th or early 20th century in the United States.\n\nOne possible theory is that the phrase originated from a popular song and dance called \"The Monkey's Uncle,\" which was performed by a vaudeville performer named Charles \"Hap\" Taintor in the early 1900s. The song's lyrics included the line \"I'm the monkey's uncle, I'm the monkey's friend.\" Over time, the phrase \"monkey's uncle\" became a catchphrase and was used to describe someone who was seen as being silly or foolish.\n\nAnother theory suggests that the phrase may have originated from the idea that a monkey's uncle would be a strange or unusual creature, much like the monkey itself. In this sense, the phrase \"monkey's uncle\" would be used to describe someone who is seen as being strange or eccentric.\n\nRegardless of its exact origin, the phrase \"monkey's uncle\" has become a common way to describe someone who is seen as being foolish or eccentric, and it continues to be used in",

The Vice President's vote is not automatic, however, and they must choose to vote in order to break the tie. If the Vice President is not present or unable to vote, the tie remains unbroken.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Vice President's role in breaking ties in the Senate is a rare occurrence.

The organization was founded in 2007 and has since worked to raise awareness about the devastating effects of nuclear weapons and to promote international cooperation to eliminate them.\n\nThe Nobel Committee chose ICAN as the recipient of the prize in recognition of its efforts to promote a nuclear weapons-free world. In its announcement, the Committee stated that ICAN had been a driving force in the efforts to prohibit nuclear weapons, and that its work had helped to bring attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons.\n\nICAN's executive director, Beatrice Fihn, accepted the prize on behalf of the organization. In her acceptance speech, she emphasized the need for international cooperation to eliminate nuclear weapons and called on all countries to work together to achieve this goal.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the world, and it is awarded annually to individuals or organizations who have made outstanding contributions to peace and conflict resolution. Previous recipients of the prize include Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Malala Yousafzai.",

It was a key battle in the early days of Islam and marked a significant victory for the Muslims, who were led by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The battle was fought between the Muslims and the Quraish tribe of Mecca, who were opposed to the spread of Islam and had persecuted the Muslims for many years. The Muslims were greatly outnumbered, but they were able to defeat the Quraish and gain a decisive victory. The Battle of Badr is considered one of the most important events in Islamic history and is often referred to as the \"Battle of the Faithful.\"",

However, the amount of venom produced by a king cobra can vary depending on several factors, such as the size and age of the snake, the season, and the individual snake's overall health.\n\nOn average, a mature king cobra can produce around 200-300 mg of venom per bite, with a maximum yield of around 500-600 mg. However, some reports suggest that the venom yield can be much higher, with up to 1.5 mL (1,500 mg) of venom produced in a single bite.\n\nIt's worth noting that the venom yield of a king cobra can also vary depending on the method of venom extraction. For example, milking the venom from a live king cobra can result in a higher yield than extracting venom from a dead snake.\n\nOverall, the king cobra is considered to be one of the most venomous snakes in the world, with a potent neurotoxin that can cause respiratory failure, card",

The brain is a highly energetic organ, accounting for only 2% of the body's weight but consuming approximately 20% of the body's energy expenditure at rest.\n\nThe process of providing energy to the brain is a complex one, involving several steps. Here's a simplified overview of how the brain gets its energy:\n\n1. Food consumption: We consume food that contains carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy.\n2. Digestion: The food we eat is broken down into smaller molecules during digestion. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, such as glucose, in the small intestine.\n3. Absorption: The broken-down nutrients, including glucose, are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine.\n4. Blood transport: The bloodstream carries glucose and other nutrients to the liver for processing and distribution to other parts of the body.\n5.

Many of the interior scenes, such as the Murphy family home and Dr. Murphy's medical practice, were filmed in Cincinnati.\n* Dublin, Ireland: The film's director, Yorgos Lanthimos, is Greek, but he chose to film in Ireland to take advantage of the country's tax incentives for film production. Many of the film's exterior scenes, such as the scenes set in the woods, were filmed in Dublin.\n* Amsterdam, Netherlands: Some of the film's interior scenes, such as the hotel room where Dr. Murphy meets with Martin, were filmed in Amsterdam.\n\nOverall, the film's locations were chosen for their visual appeal and their ability to create a sense of unease and discomfort, which is a hallmark of Lanthimos' filmmaking style.",

The Electoral College is a process established by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution, where each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population, and the candidate who receives the majority of the electoral votes, at least 270 out of 538, wins the presidency.\n\nThe Electoral College consists of 538 electors, with each state having a number of electors equal to its number of members in the House of Representatives plus its number of Senators. The District of Columbia also has three electors.\n\nDuring a presidential election, voters cast ballots for a candidate, but they are actually voting for a slate of electors who have pledged to support that candidate. These electors then meet in their respective state capitals to cast their electoral votes for president and vice president. The candidate who receives the majority of the electoral votes wins the presidency.\n\nThe Electoral College system has been the subject of controversy and criticism over the years, with some arguing that it is undemocratic and that it can lead to a candidate winning the presidency without receiving the most popular votes. However, others argue that the Electoral College ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process and prevents larger states from dominating the outcome.",

It is a synovial joint that connects the auricular surface of the sacrum and the acetabulum of the coxal bone (hip bone).\n\nThe SI joint is a gliding joint, which means that it allows for movement in multiple planes, including flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation, and circumduction. The joint is surrounded by a capsule and ligaments that provide stability and support.\n\nThe SI joint plays a crucial role in the transmission of forces between the pelvis and the lower extremities. It helps to absorb shock and distribute pressure during weight-bearing activities, such as walking, running, and jumping. The joint also helps to maintain proper alignment of the pelvis and lower extremities, which is essential for proper gait and balance.\n\nDysfunction or inflammation of the SI joint can cause pain and discomfort in the lower back, hips, and legs. This condition is known as sacroiliac joint dysfunction or SI joint syndrome. Treatment options for SI joint dysfunction include physical therapy, chiropractic care, and in some cases, surgery.",
