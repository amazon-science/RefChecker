However, here are some details on how joint sessions are conducted:\n\n- Joint sessions of parliament in India are convened to resolve disputes between the two houses - Lok Sabha (lower house) and Rajya Sabha (upper house). They are chaired by the Speaker of Lok Sabha.\n\n- If the Speaker is not present, the Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha presides over the joint session. \n\n- If the Deputy Speaker is also not present, the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha can preside over the joint session.\n\n- The Prime Minister and other union ministers may also be present during joint sessions, but they do not preside over the session.\n\nSo in summary, the Speaker of Lok Sabha is the designated presiding officer of joint parliamentary sessions in India. But the Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha and Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha can also preside when the Speaker is not available.",

He reprimanded Will for his actions but ultimately released him without jail time.\n\n- John Mighton had a relatively small role in the film overall, but his scene provided insight into Will's background and character.\n\nSo in summary, the judge who presided over Will Hunting's case in the acclaimed drama Good Will Hunting was played by actor John Mighton.

It comes from the resemblance of the fatty rear end of a chicken to the nose of a stereotypical parson (an old term for a member of the clergy or a priest).\n\nSome key points about the origin of the term \"parson's nose\":\n\n- It dates back to at least the 17th century in English. One of the earliest references is in a 1660 cookbook that referred to the \"rump\" or back end of a chicken as the \"Parson's nose.\"\n\n- It refers to the fatty, bulbous rear end of a chicken, which protrudes a bit and resembles a large nose in shape. \n\n- The term specifically compares this part of the chicken to the supposed large, bulbous noses of parsons and clergymen. The stereotype was that parsons were overweight or fond of food and drink.\n\n- It was considered the best and fattiest part of a chicken, which may be why it got compared to what a parson or priest may especially enjoy eating.\n\n- The term remained common in the UK into the 20th century but is less well known in the US today.

He played an electro-magnetic pickup guitar on the tracks \"Hittin' the Bottle Stomp\" and \"I Don't Know\".\n\n- In 1939, George Barnes recorded \"Sweetheart Land\" and \"It's a Low-Down Dirty Shame\" with Big Bill Broonzy on electric guitar. Some consider this to be the first documented electric guitar performance on a jazz record.\n\n- In 1942, Gage Brewer recorded several songs for Capitol Records using an electric lap steel guitar, which some consider the first commercial electric guitar recordings. \n\n- Les Paul is also sometimes cited as an early pioneer of electric guitar recordings in the late 1930s and 1940s. However, there is debate around whether Durham or others preceded him.\n\n- In 1950, Les Paul and Mary Ford had a hit recording of \"How High the Moon\" using overdubbed electric guitars, which helped popularize the electric guitar sound. \n\nSo in summary, while it's unclear who made the absolute first, Eddie Durham, George Barnes, Gage Brewer and Les Paul were all among the earliest pioneers of the electric guitar in recordings in the late 1930s and 1940s. The electric guitar quickly became popular and changed music after that.",

This Charkie is owned by Chef Pisghetti. \n\n- In the 2006 Curious George movie, there is a female bulldog that is sometimes referred to as Charkie. She belongs to the Bloomsberry family.\n\n- In some Curious George coloring books and kids books, a generic dog character is named Charkie. The breed is not specified.\n\nSo in summary, there is not one consistent dog breed for the character Charkie across all Curious George series and adaptations.

She was Lucy Ricardo's elderly neighbor and was played by actress Elizabeth Patterson.\n\nPatterson appeared as Mrs. Trumbull in 15 episodes of I Love Lucy from 1952-1957. She was known for her exasperated reactions to Lucy's antics and schemes. Mrs. Trumbull often provided comic relief with her sharp wit and skepticism of Lucy's plans. \n\nSome key facts about the Mrs. Trumbull character:\n\n- She lived upstairs from the Ricardos in their apartment building.\n\n- She was a widow and seemed to lead a solitary life besides her interactions with Lucy.\n\n- Mrs. Trumbull was often pulled into Lucy's schemes, like pretending to be sick to get Ricky's attention.\n\n- She claimed to have a sister named Angela who was never seen on screen.\n\n- Her first name was never revealed during the show's run.\n\nSo in summary, the role of Lucy Ricardo's meddling and quick-witted elderly neighbor Mrs. Trumbull was memorably played by veteran comedic actress Elizabeth Patterson throughout I Love Lucy's original run.",

        "response": " The last name Waters has a few potential origins:\n\n- It can be a topographical surname referring to someone who lived near water, such as a river, stream, or lake. This name would have originally been \"atte Water\" in Middle English.\n\n- It may derive from the Old English word \"waeter\", meaning water or a watery place. People with this surname likely lived near a water source.\n\n- In some cases, Waters is an Anglicized form of French surnames like Eaux, D'Eaux, or De Waters. These names mean \"of the waters\".\n\n- Waters could also be an Anglicized form of Gaelic names like Uisneach or Uisdean, which come from \"uisge\" meaning water.\n\n- In the American South, Waters was sometimes used as a surname given to or adopted by African Americans who had been enslaved. It may have referred to crossing water during escape or travel.\n\nSo in summary, the Waters surname generally originated as a descriptive name for someone associated with water, either living near it or crossing over it. The specific origin likely depended on the region and linguistic influences on the ancestor who first bore the name.",

        "response": " In the original Terminator film from 1984, the role of John Connor was played by actor Michael Edwards. Some key facts:\n\n- The Terminator was released in 1984 and was directed by James Cameron. It starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator.\n\n- Michael Edwards was cast as John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against machines in the post-apocalyptic future. \n\n- Since John Connor is just a child in the first Terminator film, Edwards was only 13 years old when he took on the role.\n\n- While Edwards was the actor who physically portrayed John Connor on screen, the voice of John heard over the radio in a few scenes was provided by Michael Biehn. Biehn went on to portray Kyle Reese in the first film.\n\n- In subsequent Terminator sequels, the adult John Connor has been played by other actors like Edward Furlong, Nick Stahl, Christian Bale, and Jason Clarke. But in the original, Michael Edwards was the first to bring the pivotal character to life.\n\nSo in summary, Michael Edwards was the actor who played the young John Connor in the 1984 sci-fi classic The Terminator, establishing the character that would be central to the franchise.",

The results show where the couples in the bottom two dance off and one is eliminated is typically recorded on the Saturday night, shortly after the main live show airs. Here are some key details about the Strictly results show recording:\n\n- The main live show airs on Saturday evenings on BBC One, usually around 7-8pm UK time.\n\n- Once the phone lines close after the main show, the studio audience stays in place and the results show is recorded straight away. This usually starts around 9:30-10pm.\n\n- The results show is pre-recorded so that no information leaks out before it airs on TV. \n\n- The Sunday results show then airs around 7:30pm UK time, about 24 hours after it was recorded on the Saturday night.\n\n- The couples in the dance off perform their routines again and the judges vote on who to save right after the main show, but this is edited down for the Sunday broadcast.\n\nSo in summary, the Strictly Come Dancing results show is recorded late on Saturday night, shortly after the live main show, and then aired the following evening on Sunday. This allows the results to remain secret until the broadcast.",

At 2.16 miles (3.48 km) long, it is the longest pleasure pier in the world.\n\nSome key facts about Southend Pier:\n\n- Construction began in 1829 and it first opened in 1830. It has been extended multiple times over the years.\n\n- The pier extends out into the Thames Estuary and has its own railway line along its length, with Pier Trains taking visitors to the end.\n\n- In addition to the pier train, attractions include an amusement arcade, shops, restaurants, and a lifeboat station at the shore end.\n\n- At the far end, there is a cafe and a viewing platform offering views of the estuary. \n\n- It suffered extensive damage from fires, storms, and collisions with boats over the years and has been rebuilt many times. The most recent extensive renovation was completed in 1999 after a fire.\n\n- At high tide, the pier head is over 1 mile (1.6 km) from the shore. At 2.16 miles long, it is the longest pleasure pier in the world.\n\nSo in summary, Southend Pier, at over 2 miles long, is confirmed as the longest pier in the United Kingdom. It has been a popular seaside attraction for nearly 200 years.",

Some of the most well-known versions are:\n\n- Aretha Franklin - Her 1967 version was the original recording and a major hit for her.\n\n- Mary J. Blige - She covered the song on her 1992 album What's the 411?\n\n- Christina Aguilera - She recorded the song for her 2002 album Stripped. \n\n- John Legend - He covered the song featuring Joss Stone for his 2006 album Once Again.\n\n- Alicia Keys - She recorded a live version on her 2007 album As I Am: The Super Edition.\n\nSo in summary, while many artists have covered \"Ain't No Way\" over the years, Aretha Franklin's original 1967 recording is likely the definitive version that popularized this soulful ballad.

        "response": " Here are some key details about the early history and recordings of the folk song \"House of the Rising Sun\":\n\n- The origin of the song is unclear, but it dates back at least to the early 20th century. The earliest published version appeared in 1925 in the folk song collection \"Minstrel Songs Old and New.\" \n\n- One of the first known recordings was in 1933 by Clarence \"Tom\" Ashley. Another early version was recorded in 1937 by Georgia Turner.\n\n- In 1941, Woody Guthrie recorded a version called \"The Rising Sun Blues.\" His recording helped bring wider attention to the song.\n\n- In the late 1950s, folk singer Joan Baez recorded an influential version of the song that became popular within the folk revival movement. Her 1960 recording helped cement \"House of the Rising Sun\" as a folk standard.\n\n- Dave Van Ronk recorded an important version in 1961, which was then adapted by Bob Dylan in 1962 for his debut album. Dylan's version was not released as a single but helped boost the profile of the song.\n\n- The most famous version was recorded in 1964 by the British rock band The Animals. Their electric rock arrangement was an international hit, reaching #1 on charts in the U.K., U.S. and elsewhere. This massively popular cover made \"House of the Rising Sun\" a rock standard.\n\nSo while the song itself dates back many decades, The Animals",

However, here are some details about the show that may provide clues:\n\n- The Crossing was a science fiction drama that aired for one season on ABC in 2018. \n\n- It was about refugees from a war-torn country in the future who travel back in time to seek asylum in the present-day United States.\n\n- The show filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which is a common location for filming TV shows and movies due to tax incentives and diverse landscapes that can stand in for many locations.\n\n- Other filming locations may have included areas around Vancouver used to represent the fictional town of Port Canaan, Oregon where the show was set. \n\nSo while Vancouver seems to have been a primary filming site, the exact shooting locations for The Crossing are not definitively known publicly. Some additional research into filming permits or production reports from the time may reveal more details about specific filming sites used in the Vancouver region. But the show does appear to have been mainly shot in and around Vancouver.",

        "response": " There is some debate around exactly who invented the first home video security system, but here are some key developments:\n\n- In 1949, German inventor Walter Bruch helped develop the technology for closed circuit television (CCTV), which allowed for video monitoring of private spaces. This laid the groundwork for modern video surveillance systems.\n\n- In 1969, CCTV systems were installed in some public spaces like banks and convenience stores for security monitoring. \n\n- In the 1970s, home CCTV systems first became commercially available, though they were expensive and not widely adopted at first. A company called VideoScan is sometimes credited with releasing the first home CCTV system in the 1970s.\n\n- In the 1980s, more affordable home security cameras and recording systems started hitting the consumer market. Companies like Radio Shack, ADT, and Brinks offered early home security systems. \n\n- In the 1990s, home security cameras became more widespread as technology improved and prices dropped. The X10 company offered some of the first wire-free security cameras for the home during this time.\n\nSo in summary, while CCTV and closed-circuit monitoring originated in the 1940s and 1950s, home video security systems emerged for consumers in the 1970s and became more popular and affordable throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The technology built on decades of CCTV development.",

Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun or too close to the sea, but in his excitement, Icarus ignored his father's advice and flew too high. The sun melted the wax holding his wings together, and Icarus fell into the sea and drowned. \n\nSo in summary, it was Icarus, the son of Daedalus, who flew too close to the sun in Greek mythology.

Here are some key points about where Bacteroides are typically found:\n\n- The human gut microbiome - Bacteroides are one of the most abundant types of bacteria found in the human intestinal microbiota. They make up around 30% of all bacteria in a healthy human gut.\n\n- Lower intestines/colon - Bacteroides are anaerobic bacteria, meaning they thrive in environments with low or no oxygen. They are most abundant in the lower parts of the intestines, especially the colon. \n\n- Mouth - Some species of Bacteroides can also be found in the oral microbiome, though in smaller numbers than in the gut.\n\n- Women's reproductive tract - Bacteroides are commonly found in the vaginal microbiota and can protect against growth of pathogenic bacteria.\n\n- Infant gut - Babies are first colonized with Bacteroides and other bacteria during birth and breastfeeding. Bacteroides make up a major component of a healthy infant gut microbiome.\n\n- Animal guts - Bacteroides are not exclusive to humans - they are also normal residents of the intestinal tracts of many warm-blooded animals.\n\nSo in summary, the main habitat of Bacteroides bacteria is the lower intestinal tract and colon of humans and other animals, where they play important roles in",

        "response": " Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\nThe UK is an island nation surrounded by seas - the Atlantic Ocean to the west and north, the North Sea to the east, and the English Channel to the south. So all major British cities are relatively close to the coast. \n\nHowever, some cities are farther inland than others. The largest and most populous cities in the UK tend to be closer to the coast due to historical access to trade and transport by sea.\n\nThe major cities that are farthest from the sea are those that are more centrally located in England or Wales, away from the coasts. \n\nAfter some analysis, the major city that appears to be farthest from the sea in the UK is Birmingham. \n\nBirmingham is located in the West Midlands region of central England. It is about 110 miles (177 km) from the closest sea - the Bristol Channel, part of the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nOther candidates for farthest city from the sea include Manchester and Leeds, but Birmingham just edges them out by a few miles.\n\nSo in summary, Birmingham is likely the major city in the United Kingdom that is farthest from the sea. Its inland, central location makes it the furthest from the surrounding coasts and oceans.",

He developed the germ theory of disease and the process of pasteurization to kill microbes.\n\n- Robert Koch (1843-1910) - A German physician who identified the bacteria that cause anthrax, tuberculosis, and cholera. He established Koch's postulates to demonstrate that a specific microbe causes a specific disease. \n\n- Joseph Lister (1827-1912) - A British surgeon who pioneered antiseptic surgery by using carbolic acid to kill microbes during surgery. This greatly reduced post-operative infections.\n\n- John Snow (1813-1858) - An English physician who in 1854 traced a cholera outbreak in London to a contaminated public water pump, establishing that cholera was spread by microbes in contaminated water.\n\nSo in summary, the germ theory of disease stating that microorganisms are the cause of many diseases was established in the late 19th century thanks to the pioneering work of scientists like Pasteur, Koch, Lister and Snow through experiments, observations and epidemiological studies. Their work was pivotal in revolutionizing medicine.",

Still, the dwarves are frightened when the bear appears. \n\n- The next morning when the group meets Beorn in his human form, Gandalf informs them that Beorn is a skin-changer who becomes a bear by night.\n\n- Beorn's bear form is powerful and used to patrol the area around his home. He is able to kill intruding orcs and wargs that come near.\n\n- His ability to become a bear is important to the story, as he helps the group escape goblins and wargs by carrying them on his back and tearing through their enemies in bear form.\n\nSo in summary, Beorn is the character who shapeshifts into a large, fierce black bear in The Hobbit.

It involved Aboriginal stockmen and their families walking off Wave Hill Station in the Northern Territory to protest poor pay and working conditions.\n\nSome key facts about the Wave Hill walk-off:\n\n- It began on August 23, 1966 when around 200 Aboriginal stockmen and their families left Wave Hill Station to camp at Wattie Creek. This was led by Vincent Lingiari.\n\n- The protest was against the poor pay and conditions for Aboriginal workers on the British-owned cattle station, as well as the lack of recognition of Aboriginal land rights. \n\n- It continued for over 8 years, making it one of the longest strikes in Australian history. \n\n- In 1975, the Australian government granted the Gurindji people title to part of their traditional lands, marking a major win for Indigenous land rights. \n\n- On August 16, 1975, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam symbolically poured sand into Vincent Lingiari's hand to recognize the Gurindji land rights, in a ceremony at Wave Hill.\n\n- In 1985, the Gurindji were granted additional land rights to more of their traditional lands with the passing of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act.\n\nSo in summary, the Wave Hill walk-off began in August 1966 and the main protest essentially ended in 1975 with the landmark Indigenous land rights victory, after almost 9 years.

        "response": " Norman Borlaug is known as the father of the Green Revolution in India. Some key points about Norman Borlaug and the Green Revolution in India:\n\n- Norman Borlaug was an American agronomist and humanitarian who developed high-yielding, disease resistant wheat varieties in Mexico in the 1940s-1960s. These varieties later spread to India and Pakistan.\n\n- In the 1960s, Borlaug worked with Indian agronomists to import semi-dwarf, high-yielding wheat varieties into India and teach local farmers new agricultural techniques. This was the start of the Green Revolution in India.\n\n- The new wheat varieties, combined with irrigation infrastructure, fertilizers and pesticides, led to dramatic increases in wheat yields per acre in India. This helped transform India from a country reliant on food aid to a net food exporter.\n\n- Wheat yields in India nearly doubled between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s due to Borlaug's semi-dwarf varieties. This helped alleviate hunger and famine in the country.\n\n- For his contributions to agriculture in Mexico, India and other countries, Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for helping fight world hunger. He has since been called the \"father of the Green Revolution.\"\n\nSo in summary, Norman Borlaug's work developing disease resistant, high-yielding wheat varieties and transferring the technology to India in the 1960s launched the Green Revolution",

Ringo Starr sings lead vocals on the song, with backing vocals provided by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison.\n\n\"Good Night\" has a lush orchestral arrangement by George Martin, featuring strings and a choir. It provides a gentle, soothing conclusion to the wide range of musical styles found on the eclectic White Album. Ringo's warm and comforting vocal performance fits the mood of the song perfectly.\n\nSo in summary, it is Ringo Starr's distinctive and soothing voice that sings lead vocals on \"Good Night\" from The Beatles' 1968 self-titled double album, commonly referred to as the White Album.",

Here are some key details about the process:\n\n- The Illinois Supreme Court has 7 justices total. \n\n- Whenever there is a vacancy in the Chief Justice position, the sitting justices vote among themselves to elect one of their members to serve as the new Chief Justice.\n\n- The Chief Justice serves a term of 3 years. After 3 years, the justices vote again on whether to retain the current Chief Justice or elect a new one. \n\n- The Chief Justice may serve successive 3-year terms if re-elected by the other justices.\n\n- The vote for Chief Justice happens behind closed doors and the process is not fully transparent to the public.\n\n- The Chief Justice is primarily responsible for administrative duties like assigning judges, setting court schedules, and managing the budget. But they still also participate in hearing and deciding cases.\n\nSo in summary, the Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court is chosen through an internal election by the sitting justices themselves, for a renewable 3-year term. The people of Illinois do not directly vote for the Chief Justice role.",

It was released in 1999 on their album The Worship Project.\n\nThe lead vocals on the original version were sung by the band's frontman Bart Millard, who also wrote the lyrics. Millard wrote the song based on his relationship with his father and imagining what it would be like being in Heaven and meeting God face to face.\n\n\"I Can Only Imagine\" went on to become a huge crossover hit on both Christian and mainstream radio. It reached #1 on multiple Christian charts and also peaked at #71 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song has been certified double platinum by the RIAA and has become one of the most popular contemporary Christian songs of all time.\n\nWhile MercyMe remains most closely associated with \"I Can Only Imagine,\" the song has also been covered by many other artists over the years across multiple genres. However, the original version by MercyMe and Bart Millard remains the most well-known and iconic recording.",

Hunley.\n\nIn 1863, Hunley built a small hand-powered submarine called the H. L. Hunley for the Confederate States of America. The Hunley was designed to attack and sink Union ships by stealth, ramming the enemy vessel with a spar torpedo. \n\nOn February 17, 1864, the H. L. Hunley became the first submarine to successfully sink an enemy ship in combat when it attacked the Union sloop USS Housatonic. However, the Hunley also sank shortly after its attack and all eight crew members died. This made the mission the first successful submarine attack in history, but also one of the first submarine disasters.\n\nThough primitive by modern standards, the H.L. Hunley demonstrated the potential of submarine warfare and paved the way for further development of submarine technology. Hunley is considered the pioneer of submarine warfare and his invention was an important milestone in naval history.",

        "response": " The 10 shilling note was a banknote issued by the Bank of England worth half of one pound sterling. It was issued from 1928 to 1970 when it was withdrawn from circulation. Some key details about the 10 shilling note:\n\n- It was first issued in 1928, replacing the previous 10 shilling Treasury note. The original 1928 design featured a portrait of Britannia on the front.\n\n- The note was changed in the early 1960s to feature a portrait of Florence Nightingale on the front. This updated \"Series C\" 10 shilling note began circulation in 1961.\n\n- With the decimalization of British currency in 1971, the 10 shilling note was withdrawn from circulation. Decimal 10 pence coins replaced the 10 shilling note beginning in 1968 in the run up to full decimalization. \n\n- The last 10 shilling notes were removed from circulation by the early 1970s. Banks were instructed to withdraw any remaining notes by the end of 1970.\n\nSo in summary, the 10 shilling banknote enjoyed over 40 years in circulation from 1928 to the early 1970s, when it was demonetized and pulled from circulation due to the UK's transition to a full decimal currency system. The last notes were withdrawn by banks at the end of 1970.",

Some key details about the setting:\n\n- It seems to be a Spanish-speaking country, likely somewhere in South or Central America.\n\n- There are references to the country having oil reserves and an unstable government, suggesting it is politically and economically volatile.\n\n- Much of the action takes place in the fictional city of Tecala, which has slums, fancy hotels, and Western corporate offices. This suggests a developing country with economic inequality.\n\n- The kidnappers are rebels/guerrillas who are fighting against the government and targeting foreign oil companies. This implies some degree of civil conflict and unrest.\n\n- Some scenes were filmed on location in Ecuador, so it seems to be loosely inspired by or modeled after certain South American countries like Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela etc. that have faced political turmoil, rebel forces, and kidnappings of foreign oil workers.\n\nSo while not named explicitly, the setting is intended to depict a fictional South American country dealing with economic and political upheaval. The movie doesn't pinpoint an exact country, but gives it the feel of a volatile developing South American nation.",

It originated in the early 20th century as a nonsensical phrase meant to express absurdity or incredulity. \n\nThere are a few theories about how this phrase became popular:\n\n- It was influenced by the Darwinian theory of evolution, implying that humans evolving from apes/monkeys is as unbelievable as a monkey having an uncle.\n\n- It refers to the fact that monkeys don't have familial relationships like \"uncles\" that humans do, so saying \"monkey's uncle\" is absurd.\n\n- It's thought to be a variant of earlier phrases like \"my aunt's cat\" or \"my grandmother's whiskers\" - meaningless phrases used to express surprise. Replacing aunt/grandmother with \"monkey\" gave it an absurd, nonsensical edge.\n\n- The phrase was popularized in the U.S. after being used in a comic strip called \"Uncle Eben's Ignorance\" where a character says \"Well knock me down for a monkey's uncle!\" in surprise.\n\nSo in summary, \"monkey's uncle\" became a humorous way to express disbelief or shock by invoking an absurd, nonsensical image that pokes fun at the idea of monkeys having human familial relationships. The silliness of the phrase conveys the feeling without having to state it directly.",

        "response": " If there is a tie vote in the United States Senate, there are a few ways it can be broken:\n\n- The Vice President of the United States, who serves as President of the Senate, can cast a tie-breaking vote. This is the most common way ties are broken.\n\n- Senators can agree to table or postpone the issue that resulted in a tie. This allows them more time to negotiate or bring in absent Senators to vote. \n\n- The Senate Majority Leader can make a motion to reconsider the vote at a later time when more Senators are present.\n\n- For votes on procedural matters, the tie vote means the motion fails. The status quo is preserved. \n\n- On votes to confirm presidential nominations, a tie vote means the nomination fails. \n\nSo in summary, the Vice President can break tie votes with their vote, but Senators have some procedural options as well if they want to revisit a tied vote later. The Vice President has cast over 250 tie-breaking votes since 1789, so it's a very common occurrence.",

        "response": " The last name Perry has several possible origins:\n\n- It can be an English surname derived from the Old English words \"pear\" (the fruit) and \"tree\". It would have originally referred to someone who lived near a notable pear tree.\n\n- It can be an English surname derived from the Old English personal name \"Piri\" or \"Pyri\", which are diminutives of names like Piers.\n\n- It can be an English surname derived from the Old French \"perriere\" meaning \"quarry\" or \"stone pit\". It would have referred to someone who lived or worked at a quarry.\n\n- It can be an Anglo-Norman habitation name referring to someone from the town of P\u00e9riers in Normandy, France. \n\n- It can be an Irish surname adopted from the English Perry/Perrie during the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century.\n\n- It can also be an Americanized form of many different surnames from various languages that sounded similar to \"Perry\" when brought to the US.\n\nSo in summary, Perry most commonly originated as an English topographical surname referring to pear trees or quarries, but had other origins as a first name or place name that was adopted as a surname. The multiple origins contributed to Perry becoming a common surname in England, Ireland, and later in America.",

Ambulatory patients are the opposite of non-ambulatory or bedridden patients.\n\n- Ambulatory care refers to medical services provided on an outpatient basis, without admission to a hospital. This includes visits to a doctor's office, clinic, urgent care center, etc. Ambulatory care is less intensive than inpatient hospital care.\n\n- An ambulatory surgery center is a healthcare facility that specializes in providing same-day surgical care, allowing patients to walk in and out without an overnight stay. Common procedures done at these centers include endoscopies, colonoscopies, cataract surgeries.\n\n- Ambulatory devices are tools designed to assist patients with walking, such as canes, walkers, crutches, etc. These allow patients with injuries, disabilities or mobility issues to move around on their own without major assistance.\n\n- Ambulatory monitoring refers to portable or wearable technology used to track a patient's vital signs or health data while they go about their daily activities. This may include ECG monitors, EEGs, glucose monitors, etc.\n\nIn summary, \"ambulatory\" implies that the patient can walk and move about to some degree, in contrast to bedbound patients who cannot independently move or walk.

But the entire hitting surface cannot exceed 4.25 inches.\n\n- The edges of the bat should also not exceed 1.56 inches in thickness. \n\n- Bat widths have become more standardized in recent decades. In the past, bats with widths up to 4.75 inches were sometimes used.\n\n- Wider bats provide a larger hitting surface but may be less maneuverable. Narrower bats allow for more control and strokeplay.\n\n- Bat width is one factor players consider when selecting a bat for their size, technique and playing style. Other factors include bat length, weight, balance and materials.\n\nSo in summary, 4.25 inches is the maximum legal width for a cricket bat under the sport's rules. Most bats today adhere very closely to this standard width.",

West Texas has large wind farms due to strong winds, open land, and abundant transmission lines.\n\n- California - The second largest producer of wind power with over 6,000 megawatts of capacity. Large wind farms exist in mountain passes and the Tehachapi region. \n\n- Iowa - The third largest wind power state with over 10,000 megawatts of capacity. Iowa has great wind resources and lots of windy open land.\n\n- Oklahoma - Has over 7,000 megawatts of wind capacity, mostly in the western half of the state where wind resources are superb.\n\n- Kansas - Has over 6,000 megawatts of wind power capacity, primarily in the high wind central and western portions of the state.\n\n- Illinois, Minnesota, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming also have significant wind power capacity of over 3,000 megawatts each. The Great Plains, mountain states, and coastal regions tend to be the windiest.\n\nSo in summary, wind power is concentrated most in the Central Plains (Texas, Iowa, Kansas) as well as California due to strong wind resources and availability of open land areas.",

It marked the end of the Race to the Sea, as the opposing armies dug extensive trench systems to hold their positions. The battle took place around the Belgian city of Ypres in West Flanders.\n\nThe battle concluded on 22 November 1914 with Allied forces managing to hold onto Ypres and the surrounding territory while preventing a German breakthrough. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, with over 200,000 total killed, wounded or missing. The battle established the trench warfare that would characterize the Western Front for the rest of the war.

It was a key battle during the early days of Islam between the new Muslim community of Medina led by the Prophet Muhammad and the Quraish tribe of Mecca. Some key points about the Battle of Badr:\n\n- It occurred on March 17, 624 CE near the town of Badr in what is now western Saudi Arabia. \n\n- The Muslims had 313-317 men while the Quraish had about 1,000 men, but the Muslims were victorious.\n\n- It was the first major battle between the Muslims and non-Muslims and proved to be a turning point for the early Muslim community.\n\n- Several important Quraish leaders were killed in the battle, weakening pagan opposition to Islam in Mecca.\n\n- The victory solidified Prophet Muhammad's position as leader of the Muslims and marked the beginning of his power in Arabia.\n\n- After the battle, many more tribes joined Muhammad and converted to Islam, strengthening the Muslims.\n\nSo in summary, the Battle of Badr in 624 CE was the first major military victory for the early Muslims against overwhelming odds and proved pivotal for the growth of early Islam under Prophet Muhammad. Its result had religious, political, and strategic significance.",

Specifically in Louisiana:\n\n- The Red River enters Louisiana from Arkansas in the northwest corner of the state.\n\n- It flows south and southeast through Shreveport and Alexandria. \n\n- Near Marksville, the Red River connects to the Atchafalaya River, a distributary of the Mississippi River. \n\n- Though part of the Red River's flow continues southeastward into the Mississippi, the Atchafalaya now carries about 30% of the combined flow of the Red and Mississippi Rivers.\n\n- The last stretch of the Red River in Louisiana flows into the Mississippi River near Simmesport in the central part of the state.\n\nSo in summary, the Red River starts in northwest Louisiana where it enters from Arkansas and ends in central Louisiana where it joins the Mississippi River near Simmesport. The Atchafalaya River splits off part of the flow in central Louisiana as well.",

        "response": " Here are some key details about the Colts leaving Baltimore:\n\n- The Colts were originally founded in Baltimore in 1953. They were owned by Carroll Rosenbloom.\n\n- In 1972, Rosenbloom swapped ownership of the Colts with Robert Irsay, who owned the Los Angeles Rams at the time. This gave Irsay ownership of the Colts.\n\n- Under Irsay's ownership, the Colts struggled both on the field and with attendance in the late 1970s. Irsay began making demands for a new stadium to replace Memorial Stadium in Baltimore. \n\n- When no agreement could be reached on a new stadium, Irsay began discussions with other cities about relocating the team. In the early morning hours of March 29, 1984, Irsay moved the Colts out of Baltimore to Indianapolis. \n\n- So in summary, Robert Irsay was the owner of the Colts when the team controversially left Baltimore for Indianapolis in 1984 after failing to reach a deal for a new stadium. Irsay's actions made him unpopular and vilified among Colts and Baltimore fans at the time.",

        "response": " Here are some key details about the venom production of king cobras:\n\n- King cobras can inject up to 7 ml of venom in a single bite. This is over 20 times more venom than most rattlesnake species.\n\n- An adult king cobra can produce up to 500 mg of venom at a time. This is enough to kill 20 people or even an elephant.\n\n- King cobras can produce new venom as quickly as every 6-7 days. So even after emptying all their stored venom in a bite, they can replenish it fairly quickly.\n\n- The venom glands of a king cobra can hold up to 1-1.5 grams of venom at maximum capacity. However, they don't always store this much.\n\n- Venom production depends on the snake's age, health, season, and frequency of use. Older, healthier snakes tend to produce more venom than younger ones.\n\n- When threatened, king cobras can repeatedly strike and inject venom. The maximum number of bites in a short time period can be over 10-12 for an adult.\n\nSo in summary, an adult king cobra has the potential to inject over 10 ml of venom overall in multiple bites in self-defense. But the average amount of venom used per bite is much lower, around 2-7 ml. Their massive venom capacity makes them one of the most dangerous snakes in the world.",

        "response": " The brain gets most of its energy from glucose. Here are a few key points about how the brain gets energy:\n\n- Glucose is the preferred fuel source for the brain. It gets glucose from the bloodstream.\n\n- The brain cannot store glucose, so it requires a continuous supply from the blood to function properly. \n\n- The brain accounts for about 20% of the body's total energy needs, even though it only makes up about 2% of the body's weight.\n\n- When blood glucose levels drop too low (hypoglycemia), brain function is impaired. That's why having regular food intake is important to maintain normal blood sugar levels.\n\n- Besides glucose, the brain can also use ketone bodies for energy in certain situations like fasting or very low-carbohydrate diets. \n\n- Ketone bodies are derived from fat and can cross the blood-brain barrier to provide the brain with energy.\n\n- The brain also requires oxygen to extract energy from glucose and ketone bodies through cellular respiration. So constant oxygen supply via breathing is essential for brain energy metabolism.\n\nIn summary, the predominant fuel source powering the high energy demands of the brain is glucose transported from the bloodstream. Ketone bodies can provide alternative energy in certain conditions.",

The opening lyrics \"Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?\" fit the show's focus on law enforcement catching criminals. \n\n\"Bad Boys\" has become closely associated with Cops over the years. Inner Circle rerecorded the song in 1995 specifically for the TV show. So in summary, the original theme song performer is the band Inner Circle with their hit song \"Bad Boys.\"",

The show has had several moderators since it first aired in 1947, with tenures ranging from a few years to multiple decades. Some of the notable Meet the Press moderators and their approximate tenures include:\n\n- Martha Rountree (1947\u20131953) - 6 years\n- Ned Brooks (1953\u20131965) - 12 years \n- Lawrence E. Spivak (1966\u20131975) - 10 years\n- Bill Monroe (1975\u20131984) - 9 years\n- Marvin Kalb (1984\u20131987) - 3 years\n- Chris Wallace (1987\u20131988) - 2 years\n- Garrick Utley (1989\u20131991) - 3 years\n- Tim Russert (1991\u20132008) - 17 years\n- Tom Brokaw (2008) - Interim moderator for a few months after Russert's death\n- David Gregory (2008\u20132014) - 6 years\n- Chuck Todd (2014\u2013present) - 8 years and counting as of 2022\n\nSo based on the publicly available information, it appears Tim Russert likely had the longest uninterrupted tenure as a full-time Meet the Press moderator at 17 years from 1991 to 2008. Determining the absolute longest tenure would require more detailed historical records of the show's early years.",

Each state gets a number of electors equal to its total number of Senators and Representatives in Congress. States with larger populations therefore have more electors. On election day, electors from each state gather in their state capitals to officially cast their votes for President and Vice President. Whichever candidate receives a majority of electoral votes (at least 270) wins the election.\n\nSo in summary, the Electoral College is the official constitutional mechanism for electing the President, with electors from each state representing the popular vote winners from their state. The candidate who reaches 270 or more electoral votes becomes the next President.",
